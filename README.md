# Design
Apropos is an attempt to solve a problem that every developer runs into eventually. You want to use a web API but you the API is confusing or has almost no documentation.
You know what you want but you can't get it without difficulty. Wouldn't it be nice to have a common language to access any sort of data?

This is what Apropos solves.
